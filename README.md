Python scripts used to generate the results from 
Device Independent security of quantum key distribution from arbitrary monogamy-of-entanglement games.

Includes calculation to generate bipartite and tripartite winning probabilities in the magic square game, CHSH game and modified CHSH
game from Pironio et al. 2009 New J. Phys. 11 045021.

Also includes scripts to generate the finite keyrates from the main theorem and the asymptotic keyrates, found using the techniques
from Brown et al. arXiv:2106.13692v2
